        <p>The mission of 350partspermillion is to illustrate the changes of the past, present, and future that represent our relationship with the environment.</p>

        <p>The second design, the Fossil Print, appears in the form of the 350 logo. The "Fossil" moniker comes from the fact that plant-based charcoal gives the print its grey color. This 350 printed in carbon is a monument to the safety of the past, menace of the present, and chaos of the future.</p>
