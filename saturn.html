The first design, the Saturn Tee, draws on the classic painting "Saturn Devouring His Son" by Francisco Goya. The
"Son" here is replaced with a piece of broccoli. The change symbolized in this design is the needed shift away from
carnivorous diets. Every year we kill over 100,000,000,000 animals just to eat. Methane emitted from agriculture is
80x as powerful a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide, but luckily has a much shorter lifespan in the atmosphere.
This represents a huge potential for keeping our temperature down. Supporting animal agriculture is supporting
climate change.
