The Mantra declares "Peace, Balance, Prosperity". These cornerstones must exist together.
The rifts present in our world only further victimize the downtrodden,  the poor, and the marginalized. Climate change's pressures will force their fingers into these rifts and split our world asunder.
Take up this Mantra in all ways, and carry these three ideas into an uncertain future. The Mantra Jacket draws on the eternal strategy of humanity: imitating nature in order to better exploit it.
In the hands of 350ppm, the camoflage is an emblem of humility. We blend in with nature because we ARE nature. All-serving, all-receiving.
