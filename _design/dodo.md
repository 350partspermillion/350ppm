The Dodo tee emphasizes the primary victims of climate change and human environmental pressures. Our most famous victim, the Dodo, was wiped from the planet before 1700. Here, two stand in solidarity. Small does not mean powerless. Down does not mean doomed.

Our actions are relentlessly accelerating the extinction rate. What can we do? Stop eating meat, stop buying animal products, stop burning fossil fuels. We have a choice. The Dodo does not.
