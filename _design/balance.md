The fourth design, the Balance Tee, calls upon classic textbook illustration and pairs it with Gamera, a monster symbolizing our uneasy relationship with the sea.
The highlight of this design—ocean acidification—is often referred to as the "evil twin" of sea level rise. 
As carbon dioxide fills the atmosphere, a large amount of it is absorbed by our oceans.
The chemical equilibrium that has persisted for billions of years means that as we add CO2, we create more H+.
We've increased H+ concentration by 28.8% from pre-industrial levels.
